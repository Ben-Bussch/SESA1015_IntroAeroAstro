  - Creating a function.
  - Vectors/arrays in NumPy.
  - Plotting data using Matplolib.
  - Loops.
- Orbit analysis of Celestial Objects (celestial_objects_orbit_analysis). Contains code to analyse the orbits of Celestial Objects (e.g., stars, planets, moons, planetary systems, star clusters). The code covers the following concepts:
  - The Astroquery toolset/library.
  - The Horizons class.
  - Querying the JPL Horizons service.
  - Plotting and analysing Mars' and Earth's orbits.
